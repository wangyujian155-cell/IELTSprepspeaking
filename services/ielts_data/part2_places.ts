          english_text: "I’d like to describe Jiuzhaigou National Park, which is located in the Sichuan province of China. It’s a UNESCO World Heritage site famous for its colorful lakes, multi-level waterfalls, and snow-capped peaks.\n\nI first knew about this place from a TV documentary when I was in high school. The footage was so breathtaking that I promised myself I would visit it one day. I finally got the chance to go there two years ago during the autumn season.\n\nThe place is like a fairyland on earth. The water in the lakes is crystal clear and changes colors from turquoise to deep sapphire depending on the sunlight and minerals. The forests surrounding the lakes were ablaze with autumn colors—red, orange, and gold—reflecting in the water. It was incredibly peaceful, despite the other tourists.\n\nI like to visit it because it provides a complete escape from the concrete jungle of the city. The air is crisp and clean, and the scenery is so majestic that it makes you forget all your worries. It’s also a paradise for photography, which is a hobby of mine.",

It was my first time visiting since its major renovation, so I was really looking forward to it.\n\nWe arrived early to soak up the atmosphere. The stadium is massive, with a very modern, bowl-shaped design that amplifies sound. During the match, we joined thousands of fans in chanting and cheering for the home team, Beijing Guoan. The energy was palpable; every time our team scored, the roar of the crowd was deafening.\n\nI felt absolutely exhilarated and a strong sense of belonging. Even though I’m just an ordinary fan, standing there in a sea of green jerseys made me feel part of a tribe.

I rented a bicycle and rode along the Su Causeway, admiring the peach blossoms and weeping willows. I also visited the Longjing tea plantations in the hills, where I learned how to pick tea leaves and tasted the freshest green tea I’ve ever had.\n\nThe city was breathtakingly beautiful and surprisingly calm for a metropolis. It perfectly blends modernity with tradition. You have ancient temples and pagodas sitting right next to bustling shopping districts, yet the pace of life feels slower and more refined than in Beijing or Shanghai.\n\nI want to visit it again because I feel I only scratched the surface.

I usually go there on weekends when I want to buy something specific for my apartment or just to get some inspiration.\n\nI like visiting it for the experience. The store layout is unique; it forces you to walk through a winding path of showrooms before you reach the warehouse. These showrooms are designed like real apartments, which gives me great ideas for interior design. It feels cozy and welcoming. Also, I can't ignore the food. I almost always stop at their cafeteria to have their famous Swedish meatballs and almond cake. It’s affordable and delicious. Visiting IKEA feels less like a chore and more like a fun day out.",

        thinking_logic: "是的，这是一种好客（Hospitality）的表现。在家聚会比在外面更私密（Intimate）和放松。可以亲自下厨招待朋友。但也有些人不喜欢，觉得准备和清理很麻烦（Hassle），或者因为住处太小/乱而感到尴尬（Embarrassed）。",

        thinking_logic: "是的，这是传统（Tradition）。拜年（Visiting relatives and friends）是春节的核心活动，旨在加强家庭纽带（Strengthen bonds）和联络感情。虽然现在有些年轻人倾向于通过视频拜年或去旅游，但互访依然是主流。",

        thinking_logic: "基本礼仪（Basic etiquette）。表示尊重（Respect）和感谢（Gratitude）主人的招待。礼物不一定要贵重，通常是水果、鲜花或酒。这是一种社交润滑剂（Social lubricant），能打破僵局，营造友好氛围。",

        thinking_logic: "交流与陪伴。分享食物（Sharing food）本身就是一种连接。大家放下手机，面对面交流（Face-to-face interaction），分享近况。这能带来归属感（Sense of belonging）和安全感。美食也是一种享受。",

        thinking_logic: "普遍认为是老人，但实际上年轻人越来越“宅”（Homebodies）。老人可能因退休和身体原因在家多，但也喜欢去公园社交。年轻人因数字娱乐丰富（Digital entertainment）和工作疲惫，周末更愿意宅家恢复精力。所以很难一概而论。",

        thinking_logic: "很难说。技术发展是指级数的（Exponential）。虽然未来的老人（也就是现在的我们）更懂技术，但新技术的形态（如脑机接口）可能完全不同。但技术也会变得更直观（Intuitive），如语音控制，可能反而降低了使用门槛。终身学习（Lifelong learning）是关键。",
